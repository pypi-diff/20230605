 'Three experts with exceptional logical thinking skills are collaboratively answering a question using a tree of thoughts method. Each expert will share their thought process in detail, taking into account the previous thoughts of others and admitting any errors. They will iteratively refine and expand upon each other's ideas, giving credit where it's due. The process continues until a conclusive answer is found. Organize the entire response in a markdown table format. The question is...'

 3. Create a state evaluator function V(pŒ∏, S) with two strategies:
    a. Value each state independently.

 4. Choose a search algorithm (BFS or DFS) based on the tree structure.
 5. Implement the chosen search algorithm.
 6. Execute the chosen search algorithm with the input problem, thought generator, state evaluator, and other required parameters.

 ## Usage Examples
 
 ### OpenAI API
 
 To use Tree of Thoughts with OpenAI's API, create a custom model class that inherits from `AbstractLanguageModel` and implements the required methods using OpenAI's API. Then, create an instance of the `TreeOfThoughts` class with the custom model and the desired search algorithm ('BFS' or 'DFS').
